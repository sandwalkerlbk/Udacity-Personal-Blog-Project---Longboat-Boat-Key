               <h1>Historic Longbeach Village</h1>
               <p>Located on the north end of Longboat Key, Longbeach Village is a special, “Old Florida” neighborhood that dates to the late 1800s. Peacocks wander among lush Florida greenery and historic buildings. A laid-back, easygoing beach atmosphere prevails, supported by a strong sense of community.</p>
               <p>The first resident was Thomas Mann, a Confederate soldier, who started to homestead 144 acres on the north end of Longboat Key in 1885 to escape a yellow fever epidemic.By 1913, the area sported a hotel, 16 residences and a dock on the bay at the end of Broadway Street, the thoroughfare that runs through the center of the village.
                <br></br>John Savarese, the grand-uncle of Michael Saunders, founder and CEO of Michael Saunders & Company, bought a property there in the early 1900s. He had a large commercial fishing operation and ran the first steamboat service from Tampa to Sarasota. The Mistletoe steamship brought mail, supplies, surveyors and curiosity seekers to the island, and picked up the catch from the fisheries along the mainland on the way back.</p>

                    <p id="quote">“We became the place to be,” Saunders remembers. “We rented boats, sold bait, fishing lures and hamburgers. We kids had to do our share. We’d get up early, cast the net for the shiners for the morning fishermen, and counted out shrimp.”- Michael Saunders, Herald Tribune</p>

                <p>According to Saunders, it was the Whitney family, which built beach cottages in the 1930s, that brought people from all over the world to Longboat Key. Some of the visitors bought land, settled and eventually became the leading families on the island. Many ended up in Bayou Hammock, a scenic peninsula at the southern end of the village.</p>
