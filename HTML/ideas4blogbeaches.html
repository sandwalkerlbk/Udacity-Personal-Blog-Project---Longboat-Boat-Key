                <p>Longboat Key’s white sand beaches beckon visitors every day of the year. During a walk near the lapping shores of the turquoise Gulf of Mexico, you’re likely to stumble across a freshly made sandcastle, a fly-fisher in search of the perfect catch, a sailboat breezily passing in the distance and any other beach-related activities you can dream up. The gorgeous white sand beaches of Longboat Key are enjoyed by residents and guests at LbK’s fantastic resorts, hotels, condos and beach houses.</p>

                <p>Longboat Key's beach is lined with private homes, condominiums and rental properties that limit public access to the beach. There are a number of public beach access points on Longboat Key leading to the Gulf of Mexico beaches. There are 12 beach access points on Gulf of Mexico Dr. None of the public beach access points have any facilities such as bathrooms, concessions or lifeguards. Although, there are restrooms at Bayfront Park parking area. The island is divided with two county lines--Sarasota and Manattee.

                    <p id="quote">“At the very North end of Long Boat Key is a natural beach area. It is preserved as natural , wilderness, as much as possible with all the development on the Gulf. This area , if you use your imagination, gives you an idea of what beauty there was on the Florida coast before we started building there. It is the Gulf in it's purest. There are not facilities at all, only a well designated trail, please stay on it, for beach access. Just a beautiful place.”- Anonymous, TripAdvisor.com
